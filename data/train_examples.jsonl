Shellshock exploit downloading Perl IRC bot Perl IRC bot The attacker performs following action here before downloading and running the bot: Terminate all the PHP and PERL instances running on the server. Attempts to delete all the content in the /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ directory. Avoids hardcoding the Command and Control server IP in the bot file that gets downloaded. Things became more interesting after this when we started seeing attacks involving tricks to add stealth and persistence to the infection. We also saw tricks used to prevent any further exploit attempts on the server by attempting to apply security patches to the server once the exploit infection was successful. Linux.Tsunami C source code In the attack case shown below, a bash script gets downloaded and executed on the target server upon successful exploit attempt. Shellshock exploit downloading C IRC bot Shell script payload downloaded upon successful exploit The shell script will perform the following actions: Downloads an IRC bot written in C programming language Attempts to compile the C bot program using gcc compiler on the victim server Executes the newly generated ELF IRC bot binary Creates a crontab entry to download and infect the system on a weekly basis This is a way of establishing persistence, even if the system administrator identifies and removes the culprit file the system will again get infected when the cronjob triggers. The attacker is also transferring a plain-text file as oppose to an ELF binary in an attempt to evade network perimeter defenses. Linux.Tsunami ELF binary In the most recent case, the attacker first ensures that the current bash session does not get recorded to the history file. It then also involved a shell script getting downloaded and executed on the target server as seen below: Shellshock exploit attempt downloading Linux.Tsunami Shell script payload downloaded upon successful exploit The shell script will perform the following actions: Downloads and executes a new variant of Linux.Tsunami DDoS bot Create crontab entry to ensure future update and persistence Attempts to download and patch the Bash vulnerability in an attempt to prevent new infections from competitors? Uses shred command before deleting itself (downloaded shell script) shred command Overwrite the specified FILE(s) repeatedly, in order to make it harder for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the data.", "thought": "To perform a threat analysis, I need to identify the key components of the Shellshock vulnerability exploitation. This includes the initial infection vector (the bash vulnerability), the types of malware payloads (Linux Backdoor Trojan, Perl IRC bots, Linux.Tsunami), and the tactics used by attackers (downloading and executing scripts, using crontab for persistence, evasion by transferring plain-text files, and applying patches to prevent further infections). I must also note the use of stealth techniques (avoiding bash history, using shred) and competitive advantage tactics (removing other payloads, patching the exploited vulnerability).", "output": "The Shellshock vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271) was exploited to execute arbitrary code through GNU Bash, leading to a variety of cyber attacks. Attackers deployed Linux Backdoor Trojans with DDoS capabilities and Perl IRC bots to infected servers. Tactics to increase infection chances included terminating existing processes, clearing temporary directories, and avoiding hardcoded Command and Control server IPs. Persistence was established through crontab entries for regular re-infection and stealth was enhanced by not recording bash sessions and securely deleting scripts with the shred command. Attackers also sought competitive advantage by patching the exploited vulnerability post-infection to prevent exploitation by others. These methods highlight the need for immediate patching and monitoring for indicators of compromise."}

We have continued to monitor the Shellshock exploit attacks and the malicious payloads that were getting dropped over the past two weeks. This blog post shares a summary of new exploit attacks and new tricks that cybercriminals have deployed to increase the chances of infection. The attacks include downloading and installation of a Linux Backdoor Trojan with DDoS capability, Perl based IRC bots that are downloaded and executed, and a C-based IRC bot that ensures persistence through crontab entries. Additionally, attackers employ evasion tactics such as Base64 encoding and plain-text file transfers to evade detection, and stealth techniques like preventing bash session history recording and using the shred command to delete traces. Cybercriminals have also been observed attempting to patch the Bash vulnerability on infected servers to prevent other attackers from exploiting it, indicating a competitive advantage strategy.", "thought": "The input provides a detailed account of the Shellshock vulnerability exploitation and the subsequent cybercriminal activities. To generate a summary, it is essential to extract the core elements such as the nature of the vulnerability, types of attacks observed, tactics used for evasion, stealth, and persistence, as well as the unique aspect of attackers patching infected servers to prevent further exploits.

With the move toward hybrid and remote work, security professionals have found themselves with more endpoints to manage and secure. Meanwhile, threat actors are exploiting gaps anywhere they can. Practicing basic cyber hygiene—applying security patches and updating software and apps—is a simple way to empower your organization. According to the 2020 Gone Phishing Report, large, well-equipped organizations have proven to be even more vulnerable. Over 75 percent of security awareness professionals spend less than half their time on security awareness, implying awareness is too often less than a full-fledged effort.

Organizations with substantial security measures are not immune, as indicated by the 2020 Gone Phishing Report, which shows that they can be more susceptible to attacks. A significant finding is the lack of comprehensive security awareness efforts, with over 75 percent of professionals dedicating less than half their time to such initiatives, potentially leading to inadequate defense against these threats.
